When water covers the road, it creates a smooth surface that reflects light more uniformly than dry asphalt. This increased reflectivity makes the road appear shiny and reflective, especially when viewed at an angle. Additionally, you can see water droplets on the windshield, indicating rainy conditions, which contributes to the overall wet appearance of the surroundings."}
